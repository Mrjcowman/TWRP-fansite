        <div class='content'>
            <h1 style>What is TWRP's Story?</h1>
            <p>Though there has been much speculation over the years about the origins of this amazing band, no theory posited could have come close to the truth revealed by the band's members: </p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li><strong class='docSung'>Doctor Sung</strong>, the band's pylon-wearing frontman</li>
                <li><strong class='meouch'>Commander Meouch</strong>, the feline bassist</li>
                <li><strong class='phobos'>Lord Phobos</strong>, rocketeer and the lead guitarist</li>
                <li><strong class="havve">Havve Hogan</strong>, the cyborg drummer with the heart of an 808 machine</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To best illustrate their story, it's best to start at the very beginning...</p>
        </div>

        <div class='content'>
            <h2 class='docSung'>The Big Bang</h2>
            <p>A lot happened here, but not too long after, Doctor Sung was born. He was orphaned in the first Ice Age, but billions of years later, he earned the 69th degree of his black belt in keytar and had an epiphany: his life's purpose would be to release humanity from the clutches of boredom through epic rock music.</p>
            <p>Sung immediately departed to search for the perfect bandmates from across the multiverse...</p>
        
            <h2 class='havve'>Finding Havve</h2>
            <p>Havve Hogan was unconscious in a cave during the Mesozoic period when Doctor Sung found him. The doctor tried in vain to resuscitate the cyborg many times, but found success when he installed an 808 drum machine in the place of Havve's heart.</p>
            <p>While Hogan had a bit of a maiming/murdering problem, his ability to hold perfect time led Sung to excuse that less-than-desirable behavior.</p>
            
            <h2><span class='phobos'>Lord Phobos</span> vs. <span class='meouch'">Commander Meouch</span></h2>
            <p>In the distant future, Commander Meouch made his fortune smuggling funk to star systems that were woefully lacking in this commodity. One of these systems was the place Lord Phobos called home.</p>
            <p>Lord Phobos was a philosopher and a rocketeer from a highly-evolved and intellectual people. When those people were met with the smuggled funk, their society devolved into chaos. Phobos swore revenge on Meouch for this destruction of his homeworld.</p>
            <p>Phobos pursued Meouch endlessly, and was nearly successful in destroying the Commander's ship when Doctor Sung appeared through a wormhole and captured them both.</p>
            
            <h2>Arriving in the Present</h2>
            <p>With Meouch's ship modified for time travel, the trio shot back to the paleolithic era to pick up Havve Hogan. Sung calculated that TWRP would thrive the most in the year 2007, so they departed for that present to make their mark.</p>
            <p>The group still makes trips out to the multiverse for Christmas, and they practice their art in the 1980's because Earth music was really at its peak then. It's their mission to bring back what they loved about that music and prevent the bleak future of trumpet rock!</p>
